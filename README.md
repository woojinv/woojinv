# About Me

### Hi there 👋

My name is Woojin Oh and I am a **life-long learner**. If I'm not learning, I'm not living 😄

I am most fulfilled when **overcoming obstacles** and **accomplishing goals** 😎

I strive to ask the right questions, see the bigger picture, and identify what matters most 🤩

Checkout my projects to see how far I've come! 👇👇👇
