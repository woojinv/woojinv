# About Me

### Hi there 👋

My name is Woojin Oh and I am a **life-long learner**. If I'm not learning, I'm not living 😄

I get the most fulfillment from **overcoming obstacles** and **accomplishing goals** 😎

I strive to ask the right questions, see the bigger picture, and identify what matters most 🤩

My projects are organized from *most recent to least recent*, so I suggest starting from the bottom and working your way up to see my progress!
